The first verite-driven project I’d worked on, reviewed 100+ hours of verite and archival footage to shape story for 2 episodes. Worked directly with editor to meet cut deadlines, gave notes that were implemented in the edit, footage was in japanese - adapted to workflow that relied on reviewing subtitled footage to shape story in Avid. 

Identified inefficiceny with archival workflow, connected archival team with software developer to write a script that reduced team-wide workload by 50%. 

Worked late to construct a massive, custom graphic construction to convey series most dramatic moment in the most compelling story. 

Supported editors on 2 additional episodes to fill archival holes and provided scenes to support narrative.
