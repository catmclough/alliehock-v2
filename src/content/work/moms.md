I joined the project in the early pre-production phase and researched potential subjects to follow. I operated as the primary producer at a post facility in Northridge, CA - adjoined to Dave Grohl’s recording studio 666. I used prior archival experience to hire an archival researcher and set up a workflow to track and ingest archival materials. I reviewed incoming footage to identify archival needs and interfaced with the managers of Dan Reynolds, Miranda Lambert and Brandi Carlile. I dropped story markers on 22 hours of interviews. Weaved archival and interview bites into concise strings for Miranda Lambert episode. Screened rough/fine cuts and provided notes that were implemented in the edit. One of my notes went unaddressed initially and went to Miranda Lambert who had the same note as I did.

Crucially, worked directly with EP Doug Pray to revise and reconstruct the show - determined episode themes and identified story beats for Dave Grohl’s life and how to place them across the episodes in the series. 

Wrote voice-over and attended Dave Grohl’s mom’s voiceover recording session. 

Fielded assistant editor candidates to hire.  Producer title. Interacted directly with Dave Grohl.
